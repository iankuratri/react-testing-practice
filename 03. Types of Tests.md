# Types of Tests

## Unit tests

Focus is on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class
or a function or a component

Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units

Dependencies are mocked

Run in a short amount of time and make it very easy to pinpoint failures

Relatively easier to write and maintain

## Integration tests

Focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together

Take longer than unit tests

## E2E tests

Focus is on testing the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed
from start to finish

Involves in a real UI, a real backend database, real services etc

Take the longest as they cover the most amount of code

Have a cost implication as you interact with real APIs that may charge based on
the number of requests

RTL strikes a balance between unit and E2E tests
