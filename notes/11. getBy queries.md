# getBy... queries

getBy.. class of queries return the matching node for a query, and throw a
descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found

The suffix can be one of Role, LabelText, PlaceHolderText, Text, DisplayValue,
AltText, Title and finally TestId

## getByRole

getByRole queries for elements with the given role

Role refers to the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) role which provides
semantic meaning to content to ensure people using assistive technologies are
able to use them

By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role

Button element has a button role, anchor element has a link role, hl to h6
elements have a heading role, checkboxes have a checkbox role, radio buttons
have a radio role and so on

If you're working with elements that do not have a default role or if you want to
specify a different role, the role attribute can be used to add the desired role

To use an anchor element as a button in the navbar, you can add `role='button'`

### getByRole Options

The accessible name is for simple cases equal to:

1. The label of a form element
2. The text content of a button or
3. The value of the aria-label attribute
