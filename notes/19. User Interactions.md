# User Interactions

A click using a mouse or a keypress using a keyboard
Software has to respond to such interactions
Tests should ensure the interactions are handled as expected

## user-event

A companion library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by
dispatching the events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser

It is the recommended way to test user interactions with RTL

### fireEvent vs user-event

fireEvent is a method from RTL which is used to dispatch DOM events

user-event simulates full interactions, which may fire multiple events and do additional checks
along the way

For example, we can dispatch the change event on an input field using fireFvent
When a user types into a text box, the element has to be focused, and then keyboard and input
events are fired and the selection and value on the element are manipulated as they type

user-event allows you to describe a user interaction instead of a concrete event. It adds visibility
and intractability checks along the way and manipulates the DOM just like a user interaction in
the browser would. It factors in that the browser e.g. wouldn't let a user click a hidden element or
type in a disabled text box
