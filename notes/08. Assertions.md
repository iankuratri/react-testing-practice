# Assertions

When writing tests, we often need to check that values meet certain conditions

Assertions decide if a test passes or fails

`expect(value)`

The argument should be the value that your code produces

Typically, you will use expect along with a "matcher" function to assert something
about a value

A matcher can optionally accept an argument which is the correct expected value
