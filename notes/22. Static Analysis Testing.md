# Static Analysis Testing

Process of verifying that your code meets certain expectations without actually
running it

- Ensure consistent style and formatting
- Check for common mistakes and possible bugs
- Limit the complexity of code and
- Verify type consistency

All types of tests run the code and then compare the outcome against known
expected outputs to see if everything works 0K

Static testing analyses aspects such as readability, consistency, error handling,
type checking, and alignment with best practices

Testing checks if your code works or not, whereas static analysis checks if it is
written well or not
