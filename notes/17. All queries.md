queryBy and queryAllBy class of queries to assert if elements are not present in
the DOM

Appearance / Disappearance?

What if elements are not present in the DOM to begin but make their way into the
DOM after some time?

For example, data that is fetched from a server will be rendered only after a few
milliseconds

We use findBy and findAllBy in that case.
