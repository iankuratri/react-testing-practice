# Code Coverage

A metric that can help you understand how much of your software code is tested

1. Statement coverage: how many of the statements in the software code have
   been executed
2. Branches coverage: how many of the branches of the control structures (if
   statements for instance) have been executed
3. Function coverage: how many of the functions defined have been called and
   finally
4. Line coverage: how many of lines of source code have been tested

Add this to your `package.json` for setting minimum coverage threshold:

```
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 80,
        "statements": -10
      }
    },
  }
```

If thresholds aren't match jest will fail.
