# Jest vs React Testing Library

## Jest

Jest is a javascript testing framework

Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs the tests, determines whether the tests

passed or failed and reports it back in a human readable manner

### React Testing Library

Javascript testing utility that provides virtual DOM for testing React components

React Testing Library provides a virtual DOM which we can use to interact with
and verify the behaviour of a react component

Testing Library is infact a family of packages which helps test UI components

The core library is called DOM Testing library and RTL is simply a wrapper around
this core library to test React applications in an easier way
