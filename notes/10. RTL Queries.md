# RTL Queries

Every test we write generally involves the following basic steps

1. Render the component
2. Find an element rendered by the component
3. Assert against the element found in step 2 which will pass or fail the test

To render the component, we use the render method from RTL

For assertion, we use expect passing in a value and combine it with a matcher
function from jest or jest-dom

Queries are the methods that Testing Library provides to find elements on the page

To find a single element on the page, we have

1. getBy..
2. queryBy..
3. findBy..

To find multiple elements on the page, we have

1. getAIIBy..
2. queryAllBy..
3. findAllBy..

The suffix can be one of Role, Label Text, PlaceHolderText, Text, DisplayValue, AltText, Title and finally TestId

getBy... queries

getBy.. class of queries return the matching node for a query, and throw a
descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found
